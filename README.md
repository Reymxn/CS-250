How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating user stories help with this?

I interpret user needs by first figuring out what the user is trying to accomplish (the goal), what constraints exist, and what “done” should look like (acceptance criteria). Then I break the work into smaller features that can be built, tested, and improved in short cycles. Creating user stories helps because it forces the requirements to be written from the user’s perspective, which keeps the focus on value instead of just technical tasks. User stories also make it easier to prioritize work, estimate effort, and confirm whether the feature actually meets the user’s expectations.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach development by planning small deliverable increments, building a working version early, and improving it through feedback and testing. I try to avoid building everything at once because it increases risk and makes changes harder later. Agile processes I want to keep using include sprint planning, maintaining a prioritized backlog, daily check-ins (or regular status updates), and sprint reviews/retrospectives. The review helps confirm the product is meeting needs, and the retrospective helps me continuously improve how I work by identifying what went well, what didn’t, and what changes to make next sprint.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means communicating clearly, being reliable with commitments, and helping the team succeed rather than focusing only on individual work. This includes asking questions when requirements are unclear, sharing progress early, taking feedback professionally, and supporting teammates when blockers come up. It also means respecting team processes (like updating tasks, attending sprint meetings, and documenting decisions) so everyone stays aligned. Overall, a good team member contributes to a positive, productive environment where the team can deliver quality software consistently.
